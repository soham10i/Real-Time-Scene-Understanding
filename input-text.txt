Artificial intelligence, often abbreviated as AI, is a field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI technologies are powering a wide range of applications, from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars, medical diagnosis systems, and recommendation engines. With advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning, AI continues to revolutionize industries and reshape the way we live and work. As AI capabilities grow, ethical considerations around privacy, bias, and transparency become increasingly important topics of discussion.
